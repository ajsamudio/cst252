		<h3>Challenge</h3>
			Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.
		<h3>Problem</h3>
			Getting used to writing in Javascript. Was trying to use .sort and .reverse on a string at first then thought of switching to an array.
			Also text box popped up first which made my try button useless and later removed.
		<h3>Results</h3>
			Here are the executed code:
	<div>
        <h2>Script Output</h2>
        <script src="js/lab7.js"></script>
	</div>
</body>
</html>
