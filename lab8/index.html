		<h3>Challenge</h3>
		Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.<br>
				<h3>Problem</h3>
			Getting used to writing in Javascript. Was trying to use .sort and .reverse on a string at first then thought of switching to an array.
			Also text box popped up first which made my try button useless and later removed.<br>
		<h3>Results</h3>
			Here are the executed code:<br>
	<div>
        <h2>Script Output</h2>
        <script src="js/lab8.js"></script>

</div>
</body>
