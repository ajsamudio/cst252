		<p>Hello, I am AJ Samudio. 20 years old born and raised in Union City, California. I am currently a third year at California State University of Monterrey Bay, going for a Bachelor Degree of Science in Communication Design and a minor in Computer Science. When Iâ€™m not working on school, I find passion in creating websites, motion graphics, games, animation and exploring my creativity. Other hobbies I enjoy are playing basketball, going biking or being active. In the near furture I plan on landing a career making motion graphics or programming. ðŸ™‚</p>
